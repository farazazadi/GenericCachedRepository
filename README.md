# Generic Cached Repository

Simple implementation of `Generic Cached Repository` and `Distributed Caching` by [`Redis`](https://redis.io).

## Before running the project

* If you already have an up and running instance of Redis, just set its URL and port in `appsettings.json`. Otherwise,  you can set up your local instance of Redis on Docker using [`Compose.yml`](https://github.com/farazazadi/GenericCachedRepository/blob/main/Docker-Compose/Compose.yml) in `Docker-Compose` directory.
